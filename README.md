This repository contains the code for our course project in EE 677:  VLSI and CAD, with the title of Hamiltonian Paths and Algorithms. In this project, we aim to develop a model of the Travelling Salesman Problem and add some interesting constraints to it, ultimately showing the simulation on Pygame.
